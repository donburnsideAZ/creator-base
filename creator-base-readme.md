**Theme Setup Guide**

*Everything you need to make your site look great, right out of the box.*

---

## Quick Start

Creator Base is designed to look right immediately. No complex setup, no mystery settings. Here's what you need to get started:

1. Upload your logo in **Appearance → Customize → Site Identity**
2. Set your colors in **Appearance → Customize → Colors**
3. Add a hero background image (optional) in **Appearance → Customize → Hero Section**
4. Start publishing! Paste your YouTube URLs and go.

## Image Size Reference

Use these dimensions for best results. All images should be JPG or PNG format.

### Featured Images (Post Thumbnails)

Featured images appear on archive pages, in the hero carousel, and as social share previews.

| Recommended Size | Aspect Ratio | File Size |
|------------------|--------------|-----------|
| 1280 × 720 pixels | 16:9 (matches YouTube) | Under 500 KB |

*Tip: YouTube thumbnails are perfect! Just download and use directly.*

### Hero Background Image

The hero section spans the full width of the browser. Use a large image or a seamless pattern.

| Type | Recommended Size | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| Photo Background | 1920 × 600 pixels minimum | Wider is better; will be cropped |
| Pattern/Tile | 200–400 pixels square | PNG with transparency |

*The Customizer lets you control background size (cover, tile, contain) and position.*

### Promo Widget Images

Promotional images appear in the sidebar or horizontal promo bar, depending on screen size and layout settings.

| Layout | Recommended Size | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------|
| Sidebar (Desktop) | 400 × 400 pixels | Square works best in sidebar |
| Horizontal Bar | 300 × 250 pixels | Standard web banner size |
| Flexible Option | 400 × 300 pixels | Good compromise for both layouts |

*Add promo images using the Image widget in Appearance → Widgets → Promo Area.*

### Site Logo

| Recommended Size | Format |
|------------------|--------|
| 400 × 100 pixels maximum | PNG with transparency, or SVG |

*Horizontal logos work best in the header. The theme will scale your logo to fit.*

### Site Icon (Favicon)

| Required Size | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| 512 × 512 pixels | Square; WordPress generates all sizes |

*Use an icon-only version of your logo, not the full wordmark.*

## Color System

Creator Base uses four main colors, all adjustable in the Customizer:

| Setting | What It Controls |
|---------|------------------|
| Accent Color | Links, buttons, category badges, hover states, and highlights |
| Background Color | The main page background behind all content |
| Card Background | Hero section, content cards, and article backgrounds |
| Text Color | Primary text; lighter shades are calculated automatically |

*Tip: Start with your brand's primary color as the Accent, then build from there.*

## Publishing Content

Creator Base handles videos, podcasts, and blog posts—all with the same simple workflow.

### For Videos

Paste your YouTube URL into the Video Embed URL field. The theme automatically creates a responsive embed, extracts the video ID, and displays view counts if available.

### For Podcasts

Paste your podcast embed URL (Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.) into the embed field. Works the same way as videos.

### For Blog Posts

Just write! Add a title, your content, a featured image, and publish. No embed URL needed.

### What You Need for Each Post

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Title | Your post headline |
| Content | Your description, show notes, or article |
| Excerpt | Short summary for archives (optional—auto-generated if blank) |
| Featured Image | Thumbnail for archives and social sharing |
| Categories | Organize your content (shows, seasons, topics) |
| Embed URL | YouTube, podcast, or video URL (for media posts only) |

*That's it. No custom fields to learn, no complex block layouts to build.*
